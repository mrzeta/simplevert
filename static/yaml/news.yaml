- title: New updates to the site
  date: 4/26/2014
  body: |
      Today we're glad to announce the release of v0.6 of our SimpleCoin software.
      This includes the following interface improvements:
      <ul><li>Sorting for all tables on the site. Just click the headers to sort by that column.</li>
          <li>Prioritized recently visited stats. The addresses you visit the most often will naturally be at the top of the list.</li>
          <li>See orphan percentage, effective payout/MH/day, and all time luck on pool stats</li>
          <li>View the networks difficulty/hashrate over time in our new Network Stats. Note that we're still smoothing out the kinks, so some things may be a bit off.</li>
          <li>See all transactions for your address, instead of just the last 20</li>
          <li>Set a donation amount that is isn't a whole number, like 1.5%</li>
      </ul>
      In addition to these frontend improvements there were numerous backend
      improvements that should help keep our site running quickly. There may 
      still be a few lingering bugs here and there that we'll be working to
      fix in the next couple days. Let us know on IRC if you see anything that
      looks off.
- title: Minor vardiff bug causing false rejects
  date: 4/15/2014
  body: |
    We've identified a bug in our vardiff server - which causes a some false rejects to occur.
    It does not impact your actual mining perfomance at all. If this concerns you just switch away 
    from vardiff for now. Basically, occasionally vardiff will tell your
    client to submit shares which match a difficulty lower than vardiff is accepting. This means the server
    then rejects those low diff shares. You are not actually losing any performance, because its still 
    accepting shares at the correct difficulty(statistically its the same), it just gives you 
    rejected messages when it shouldn't. We'll be patching this (and it'll require a reboot w/ a min or 
    two of downtime), probably in the next week.

      I know a lot of people have been asking and it's finally here! Apologies
      for the delays, but we wanted to make sure we didn't release something
      subpar. You can connect to the vardiff server on port 3344 instead of
      3343.

- title: Stats upgrade pt.2
  date: 4/5/2014
  body: |
    If you're using PPAgent you can now view historical graphs of temperature and actual hashrate.
    We will be tweaking them a bit for the next while. Let us know if there's other stats you'd
    like to see graphed!
- title: Stats upgrade pt.1
  date: 4/1/2014
  body: |
    Worker stats have been improved. Now your workers are sorted (numerically/alphabetically).
    Also, if you're using PPAgent you'll notice it now calculates your WU, Total Hashrate, and
    WUE at the worker level. The WUE has a status indicator to give you an idea of the health
    at a glance. In the next few days(pt 2) we'll be rolling out temperature and hashrate graphs
    for ppagent stats.
- title: ~12 minutes of downtime last night
  date: 3/31/2014
  body: |
    Last night we had a minor issue with our queueing server that caused work to
    be lost for about 12 minutes (~4:17-4:29 GMT) while we patched it live. We've 
    fixed the issue and do not expect it to be a problem in the future.
- title: Simple Vert Launch!
  date: 3/29/2014
  body: |
    Simple Vert is now up and running! With the same base software as Simple Doge
    we're bringing new features to the growing vertcoin community as well.
